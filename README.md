# STM32 LQFP64 Test Board

A test board designed for STM32 microcontrollers in LQFP64 package. It is intended for use with the STM32F3 and STM32F0 64-pin MCUs, which are mostly pin-to-pin compatbile. The board is programmable via JTAG and SWD using the [STLINK-V3MINIE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stlink-v3minie.html) programmer.
